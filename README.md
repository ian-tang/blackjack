# Blackjack

A web page which allows the user to play a game of blackjack against the dealer (the computer).

This is a greatly simplified version of blackjack in which the player only has 2 options, hit or stand. There is no betting and the player does not get any of the other blackjack gameplay options: split, double down, and insurance.

It also uses a simplified modeling system for drawing cards. Each new card is simply randomly generated, effectively the same as if it were drawn from a completely new deck of 52 cards. Thus, there may be duplicates in play. However, the actual probability differences are minor when considering that casino blackjack often uses 6-8 decks of cards simultaneously.

This project was created as part of the admissions process for the Codeworks Software Engineering Immersive course.
